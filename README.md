## Overview

This repository contains an interactive agent that fetches, analyzes, and visualizes stock data using yfinance and matplotlib. The agent can:

* Plot stock data for a given ticker
* Compute basic statistics
* Compare multiple stocks

## What is a Ticker?

A **ticker** (or **ticker symbol**) is a unique abbreviation used to identify a publicly traded company's stock on a stock exchange.

**Examples of Ticker Symbols:**
* **AAPL** → Apple Inc.
* **MSFT** → Microsoft Corporation
* **TSLA** → Tesla, Inc.
* **GOOGL** → Alphabet Inc. (Google)
* **AMZN** → Amazon.com, Inc.

## How to Use the Agent

Once the agent is running, you can enter the following commands:

### 1. Get Stock Data for a Single Ticker

To fetch stock data for a specific company:

```sh
get AAPL 6mo 1wk
```

This command retrieves **6 months** of data for **AAPL**, sampled **weekly**.

### 2. Compare Multiple Stocks

To compare stock performance of multiple companies:

```sh
compare AAPL MSFT TSLA
```

* **AAPL** → Apple
* **MSFT** → Microsoft
* **TSLA** → Tesla

### 3. Get Basic Statistics

To fetch key statistics (like mean, standard deviation, etc.) of a stock:

```sh
stats AAPL
```
